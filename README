wcexport - WebChart Export Utility

This standalone app allows webchart users to use the Print Chart feature of WebChart to export pdf charts from the system.

To use this script you must have:
1) URL to the WebChart system
2) A Print Definition to use
3) A system report that queries for the charts to be exported
4) Valid WebChart credentials

Enter the required information into the utility's fields and click 'Begin Export'
The printed charts will be downloaded to the user's home directory in the wcexport folder.

The system report on the system must contain 'pat_id' as a column in the report.
Additionally, a column of 'filename' will determine what to name the downloaded pdf files.

To compile this script for a Windows executable, run the following on a Windows system:
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name wcexport main.py
